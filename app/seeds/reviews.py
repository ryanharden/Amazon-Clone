    review1 = Review(user_id=2, product_id=1, rating=5, headline="Unleash the Power: The ultimate Batteries!", body="I recently purchased the Amazon Basics 36 Pack AA Alkaline Batteries and I must say, I am beyond impressed! These batteries are a true powerhouse, providing long-lasting and reliable power to all of my devices. Whether it's a remote control, wireless mouse, or even a children's toy, these batteries get the job done and keep my devices running smoothly./nWhat I love most about these batteries is their impressive lifespan. I have used them for weeks on end without having to replace them, which saves me time and money in the long run. And even better, they come in a pack of 36, ensuring that I always have spare batteries on hand when I need them./nThe Amazon Basics Batteries are also incredibly affordable, making them a great value for their quality and reliability. They are the perfect solution for anyone looking for a cost-effective way to power their devices without sacrificing performance.")
    review2 = Review(user_id=3, product_id=1, rating=4, headline="Great Battery for the money", body="Price is great compared to say Duracell or Energizer. I have been buying these a long time and still get duracell or energizer from time to time when they have a good sale. I have never had an issue with dead batteries as I have heard some reviewers mention and I have been getting these for years and I am sure I have used well over a few hundred Amazon batteries and never had a dead on arrival. As for their performance I have to admit I have never done any kind of real test to compare but I will say my impression is they may not last as long as Duracell or Energizer but the difference is not worth the price difference in my opinion. I bought these in my subscribe and save accont and at .22 a battery I don't think you can go wrong. So I would give these batteries a shot.")

In my bathroom, I tend to have an issue with towels getting the nasty mildew smell do to poor air flow. I haven't had mine fade after washing and drying them. They soak up water well in my opinion.")
    review4 = Review(user_id=5, product_id=2, rating=3, headline="Pretty functional once I got the lint under control", body="First time I ordered them ,The start was a bit rough , first few uses were so bad . My kid grabbed one and then started crying because of all the black lint stuck on o them. They took another bath to wash off the lint . I prewashed them too . By the 4th wash it got much better . Stil a little bit of lint but . It's a decent size . If they had not shed tons of lint I woulda given 5 stars . It's a 4 star purchase . Maybe 3.5 but I'm gonna round up .When I wrote the review for these I had only bought them once . When I was looking the listing I ended up buying another set from the amazon warehouse for $7 shipped for the set of 2. I figured since I knew they shed I'd just wash them a few times before using them . Id done 1 pre wash and it wasn't enough to stop it from shedding so when I ordered them a second time I had a plan and didn't mind the extra effort because the price was a deal . I realize the warehouse item I bought was not brand new but it said new but in different packaging then it originally came in . I see people get mad when they receive repackaged items from Amazon warehouse ")
    review5 = Review(user_id=6, product_id=3, rating=5, headline="Incredible Value for the Best Hangers!", body="These hangers are incredible! They keep my clothes from slipping off in the closet - so I have been able to hang all of my camis, silks and every kind of top that typically slips off a regular hanger. And, because of their unusual shape, they haven’t left a funky hanger dent in the shoulder of my tops. I couldn't believe how many were included in a pack too! I was able to get everything I needed hung by ordering 1 pack of 50. Because these hangers keep things from slipping so well, I would not use them to hang pants. Because of their slip resistance, I found it difficult to thread them through the opening. But these are working so well for what I needed!")
    review6 = Review(user_id=7, product_id=3, rating=2, headline="Mixed Review", body="For those items of clothes that never stay on a hanger, these are indeed perfect. The velvet acts as velco with most fabrics that I tried. I will absolutely be using these for those items. I ordered the navy velvet pack of 50. For day-to-day regular clothing, these hangers would put me over the edge. Since the velvet acts as velco, everything sticks. If you like your clothing to hang neatly on the hanger, each shoulder will have to be placed just so. There is no sliding this hanger into a shirt. Think flannel sheets with flannel jammies. Just a lesson in frustration, lol. Broke the first hanger I used pushing it too hard into a crewneck sweatshirt. They do bend a bit but bust quite easily. Oh, and drop one on the floor, it will gather every cat hair, piece of lint, thread whatever from the location it lands on. Overall, I'm glad I do have some of these types of hangers for certain clothing, but not good in my opinion for every day. UPDATE: I changed my review from 3 to 4 stars for the simple fact that I do reach for these for certain articles of clothing more than I expected.")

Took the ball out of the bag and it was covered in smelly oil. The whole ball was slippery. I immediatly made a hot sink with soapy water and washed the ball thoroughly. Once dry, the smell was still present - not as bad. I like the look and the ball works great and seems super tough. I have used it for a few workouts now, and I find my hands have a residue on them after - which has the same unpleasant smell, and anywhere the ball has been on our laminate flooring is a super slippery spot. Both my dog and child have seriously wiped out. So, not overly pleased with this oily residue that is still coming out of it.")

The device found no codes so I thought I was ok, but nope, failed smog a second time, wasted the money on the smog check. Permanent codes cannot be cleared by any tool, only the vehicle itself can clear it after enough 'drive cycle' conditions happen./nHowever.. the device does check sensor readiness, so I should have used that as a clue.")
    review13 = Review(user_id=5, product_id=7, rating=5, headline="Great device for the size!", body="I had purchased a device like this one a couple years ago, but the end broke. So for the price and how handy it is, I just ordered a new one. This one is just a bit smaller but does the same thing. I keep it right underneath the back side of the passenger seat and use it quite often to keep my tires inflated to the proper size. I also use it for my bicycle. It works great, and saves trying to find an air compressor at a station somewhere.")

    review15 = Review(user_id=7, product_id=8, rating=5, headline="5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent!", body="The trickiest part is the installation. If your current car cup holder has a deep slot for a mug handle (for instance), you have to hold the expanders from turning while you tighten this cup holder extender. Otherwise, one of the three expanders will end up in the car's 'coffee mug handle slot' and render the extender loose and useless. Once you get it anchored in, you're golden :-) I would highly recommend this Car Cup Holder Expander Adapter.")
    review16 = Review(user_id=9, product_id=8, rating=1, headline="Quality could be way better", body="Quality: Quality is ok. Quite flimsy but a little sturdiness makes it ok. Even paid at 39$ in promo. Quality could be a ton better for the price. Cheap plastic and I feel like it could easily break. I will personally keep it to see how it does since I work on the road and absolutely need a solution for large water bottles. Otherwise, I would have returned it.")
    review17 = Review(user_id=8, product_id=9, rating=5, headline="Impressed with build quality and did it's job.", body="I have only used it once, but appears to be well made and did it's job. I chose this over others because of the design and case for ease of storage in my vehicle. I have an older secondary vehicle that I have not driven in 4 months with a completely dead battery (I should have disconnected the car battery). This Nexpow jump started it up on the first attempt. I had previously attempted to start it with my 12 year old heavy jump starter and discovered it finally bit the dust. To be able to do the same job with something so much lighter that I can store in my trunk or glove box is impressive. It comes with a nice case, jump start cable attachment, and usb cable to charge it (the unit came 75 percent charged - 3 lights out of 4).")
    review18 = Review(user_id=5, product_id=9, rating=4, headline="Defective Clamp separated after use, replaced item", body="This battery charger seems quite powerful. I've owned several such items. The only problem is it's cable was defective, and separated after plugging into the pack then removing. Others seem to have had the same problem as written in the questions. I have reached out to seller requesting a replacement, and will update depending on response.Update: I reached out to seller via Amazon, and seller sent me a complete replacement. While this was not necessary, and only the cable was defective, it is appreciated. I've updated my feedback from 1 to 4 stars for the quality of the seller, and the replacement cable (and battery) seems to be in order.")

When I'm rushing in the morning before work, it's nice that I can throw everything in the cooker, go get myself ready, wrap the finished sandwich in foil, and throw it in my purse for later. At 6:30am I'm not going to mess with clanking pans and utensils and wake my family up.")

I think this can replace all my other gadgets and this will be enough. I'm not ready to let go of my ceramic mandoline yet, but I think I will be able to eventually. The size of this is not so big. When it arrived I thought it was going to be big because of the packaging, but it's a perfect size. I can store it no problem. I have to see if this is a good grater, so I can get rid of my hand grater eventually too. But I'm not sure just yet.

If you need to move something down towards the blade, it's already completely closed so you can shake it and pop it straight back on there. When you're done, you rinse the blade (also ridiculously easy) and you're good to go again. I will admit that I fall below average on blender usage, so ease of use and minimal risk of creating a mess were key in the decision process. There hasn't been a day that we haven't used this at least twice because it takes like 2 minutes start to finish, including clean up.")

If you're like me, you just bought a box of these out of habit and then were dismayed when you opened it up... Perhaps a look of incredulity passed over your face as you inspected your purchase and didn't see the shiny resealable sticker on the top of each wipe package. Then you saw the words 'Pull open or cut at sides' printed near the edge, with cute little scissors and a dotted line showing you where you are supposedly expected to open your wipes to use.")

The diapers inside had not been opened and were still in their plastic bags.Now the diaper itself. It feels thinner than the Pampers Baby Dry that I bought at our local grocery store. I have two photos comparing the Pampers Baby Dry from the store, to Huggies and these Pampers Swaddlers bought off Amazon.

However, we've kept disposable diapers on hand for travel. We've been using Pampers Swaddlers as our “back up” diapers since my son left the hospital. I used all of the samples we received of other diapers and these, by far, were the best for us. My son is 14mo old now and we started using these as his overnight diaper to prevent leaks. They work like a charm. They're soft, absorbent, and my son hasn't had a diaper rash yet.

Normally, the bald spots regrow hair within a couple of months but this time, I'd had two bald spots for almost 6 months, so decided to give this hair oil a try.The first week, I rubbed a couple of drops in the bald areas morning and night, massaging the area and pressing in gently with my fingernail. By week two, I began noticing little baby hairs coming in. Amazingly fast.By week 4, my routine became to apply the oil every other day and two months later, I'm still doing this. This oil is very light in consistency and has a nice scent. The mint in it is not too strong, it doesn't irritate the scalp, at least in my case, and I have sensitive skin.")

I used to take super powerful medicine...don't do it. It screws up your hormones even more in the long run. Acne is a huge part of PCOS, and can get out of control very quickly. Keep in mind that I have also been implanting new diet changes (DF, GF, sugar free, no eggs, no grain, low carb) and supplements as directed by my Naturopath.I was desperate to finally change my skin. I had to be in my brother's wedding in 6 weeks, and I so badly wanted to feel confident in my skin. It was risky .

My skin is very very sensitive and it does cause some redness so I may not be able to use 2x daily as instructed (or I'll likely just have to work my way up). It's disappointing that the instructions for using the product aren't exactly clear. The first day I used a cotton pad to apply it and the second day I just used my fingers, thus delivering more product to my skin (and more noticeable redness that day). The packaging is interesting because it has a screw cap, then under that there is a flip cap that you use to actually get the product out. Despite these two caps and plastic wrapping, the product still leaked out during shipping, as shown in the photo. I will continue to use it and update after a few weeks of use.")

And it's been a solid phone. Occasionally, you'll see some lag moving from app to app. I turned off the screen animations and that stopped most of the lag. But for only $400? It's a really nice phone. I don't think I'll ever buy another high-end phone. This phone does everything I need it to do. The photos look good and it's fast enough for me.

I'm not sure what they were expecting, but I didn't expect it to be set up. After spending some time properly setting up and then taking it out on some rough trails, I think this is a pretty good bike for the money.\nI lost one of the reflectors after my first ride, but I think that might have been because It wasn't set up correctly. The seat isn't the best especially for a hard tail.\nI am notoriously hard on bikes as most of the cheaper bikes I've bought are pretty much thrashed within a year or two. I think this one will hold up better. It is noticeably lighter than our other bikes as this one is aluminum and the others are steel. We will see how it holds up some time down the road.")

Very appropriately, it includes Ahsoka, an 'Ahsoka' clone and two battle droids. Getting the ATT out of the way, as I think the draw of this set are the minifigures, I think the build was ok, it is very small so it should take about 30 minutes to complete and once done you end up with an fine toy. While the canon is too large and the ATT itself it's smaller than previous versions, I'm sure kids and younger collectors will have a good time playing with it. It's a 6.5 out of 10 for me. Minifigures:Ahsoka: A must-have figure if you are a fan of The Clone Wars. The metallic printing on the chest and leg piece are perfectly sharp as well as the prints for both of the faces")

Feeling nostalgic, I purchased this small set, about 11 inches of track. It came today and I was up and running in 5 minutes. There are reasons for cars sliding off the track or getting stuck. This is normal behavior out of the box, for several reasons, most of which are fixable. You can't fly tight through turns or curves full power. Look up videos on tuning slot cars, you can have consistent power around the track by making sure your track is fully connected and locked, and your brushes are configured in a way that provides a downforce. It's fun, don't get frustrated over these things")

The first one was Victory Lane, which I liked better. I am no expert but not a beginner either. Loved them as a kid and now wanted to play with my kids. Things to consider with this one: If you or your kids, especially impatient ones, are new to slot car racing you might want to get a different track to start. This one requires more precise control of the controller or else the cars will fly off the track, especcially if you use Turbo mode which I could only use very briefly on the loops. The end where it goes up about 60 degreees I found to be the most frustrating part with trying to keep the correct speed, most of the time it did not make it around that curve. I gave up with this track and connected many pieces of this track to my Victory Lane set and made a longer, less technical track where I can use Turbo more.")
